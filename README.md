Well, this is a bot for Oricoffee House, what else?

## Getting Started

This bot is mine, you don't have to start anything or even come here, what are you even doing here?

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
- Discord
- Nothing else, really
```

### Installing

Open Heroku, put your usual password but with a * behind, and then voila!

```
- Your Heroku passwordh as a * alongside with your usual password
- Same goes for GitHub, it contains the word "akata" in front of it

If your bot is offline, check your worker, the log, and make sure your code is not a shit.
